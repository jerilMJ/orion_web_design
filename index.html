          The IEEE Student Branch of College of Engineering, Chengannur is one
          of the most bustling and active student branch in the Kerala R10
          region. During these trying times, it is only natural for an engineer
          to think what he/she might be able to do that can lend a helping hand.
          To quench the thirst of the young engineers, the SB held a product
          design competition to engineer a robotic hand sanitizer which would
          sense when a hand would approach it and dispense enough sanitizer to
          cleanse the user's hands. Thus the SB is proud to present the
          top-voted design:

          <br /><br />

          This no-touch approach would ensure that no microbial virus or
          bacteria come in contact with the user's hands and so there is no
          worry for its spread.

          The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is a
          global association and organization of professionals working toward
          the development, implementation and maintenance of technology-centered
          products and services. <br /><br />
          IEEE will be essential to the global technical community and to
          technical professionals everywhere, and be universally recognized for
          the contributions of technology and of technical professionals in
          improving global conditions. <br /><br />
          IEEE’s core purpose is to foster technological innovation and
          excellence for the benefit of humanity.

          <br /><br />

          The Government College of Engineering Chengannur (established in
          1993), commonly known as CEC, is an engineering institute in the state
          of Kerala, India. The college is located in Chengannur, Alappuzha. The
          college was set up under the auspices of the Institute of Human
          Resources Development (IHRD), is affiliated to the Cochin University
          of Science and Technology, Kochi, and the courses are recognised by
          AICTE and accredited by NBA, the National Board of Accreditation,
          India. CEC is the Best Engineering College after Model Engineering
          College in Kerala under KTU, as per the statistics of Director of
          Technical Education, Kerala, who is the final voice of technical
          education in Kerala State.
